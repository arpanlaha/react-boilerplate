# [react-boilerplate](https://react-boilerplate.arpanlaha.now.sh/) [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/arpanlaha/react-boilerplate.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/arpanlaha/react-boilerplate)

## Overview

This is a React boilerplate that I built in order to learn how to to integrate the different technologies I use in it as well as as a template for [building out](https://github.com/arpanlaha/arpanlaha.com) my [personal website](https://arpanlaha.com), as well as potential other use cases such as with [Hack4Impact UIUC](https://github.com/hack4impact-uiuc).

This boilerplate supports Next.js, Redux, SCSS, and is written in TypeScript. I used the following examples and projects for guidance:

- [Next.js's Redux example](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-redux)
- [Hack4Impact Recruitment Portal](https://github.com/hack4impact-uiuc/h4i-recruitment)

## Usage

While still a work in progress, this boilerplate intends to demonstrate use cases for all of its functionality, and aims to maximize its scores using [Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/).

Additionally, this boilerplate is usable with [Now 2.0](https://zeit.co/now) with zero additional configuration, and comes with a `config.yml` file for running audit, format, lint, and typecheck scripts on [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/).
